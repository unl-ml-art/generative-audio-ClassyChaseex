# Project 2 Generative Audio

Karston Chase, kchase4@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

In my project I would want to have an AI assist me in making an original song. The AI could generate texts for lyrics, a background beat, and even try to interpret the lyrics into song. Obviously getting all three of these to line up and work together would be difficult and wouldn't happen on the first try. What I would do is cherry pick the best of those three categories that I feel work best together and then add a little bit of humanity to it. Any awkward sounding beats or weird drop offs could be manually fixed by me and then I could sing the lyrics in a more natural sounding way than I'm guessing the AI could.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
